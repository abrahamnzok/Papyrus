# Papyrus

Simple Text Editor with some basics functionality made by Abrahamnzok (Abraham MUBANZO) and Luctum (Hugo PALLA).

The goal of this project was to implement some design Patterns.

The project takes the form of a text editor declined in 3 versions.

We made the UI with JavaFX.

What it does :
- Insert, Select, Copy, Paste and Cut characters
- Register a sequence of Commands as a "macro" and replays it in the same order.
- Undo and Redo actions multiple times.

What it does not do :
- Use keyboard shortcuts
- Delete multiple characters at a time.

Even if we made the binding between the Delete function and Del / Backspace keys, we highly recommend to only use the buttons on the UI.
