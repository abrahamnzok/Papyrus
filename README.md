# Papyrus

School project made by Abrahamnzok (Abraham MUBANZO) and Luctum (Hugo PALLA).
The goal of this project is to implement some Design Patterns seen in the ACO module of M1 MIAGE.

The project takes the form of a text editor declined in 3 versions.

We made the UI with JavaFX.

What it does :
- Insert, Select, Copy, Paste and Cut characters
- Register a sequence of Commands as a Macro and replay it in the same order.
- Undo and Redo actions multiple times.

What it does not :
- Use keyboard shortcuts
- Delete multiple character at a time.
